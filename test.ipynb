Will certainly use them again and again until they start behaving like others in town \\\\r\\\\nThank you B&W team for your support.” Sandeep (Feb 2016)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"“No doubt Black & White Estate Agents are the best in the area. Fantastic staff members who give more than your average estate agent service. I have used Black & White Estate Agents over a number of years and would always highly recommend them- They are approachable and really do look after their landlords interests.” Reena (March 2016)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"“Black & White were such a pleasure to work with. From the first viewing of the property right through to the signing of the lease - information was provided timeously and I felt that they went out of their way to accommodate our requests. I have recommended them to others who are looking to rent property in Milton Keynes\\\\r\\\\nMany thanks to Chris and the team!!!” Geraldine (Jan 2015)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"“We recently rented a property from Black & White Estate Agents. Upon moving in, we found the property to be in a good state with all the necessary things at place, therefore was easy to get settled.\\\\r\\\\nThey are prompt to fix issues we face in a minimum time frame. Very happy with the services provided by Black & white Estate Agents\\\\\" Sruthi (April 2015)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"“As a young couple looking for our first home together, the task was daunting however Chris was very helpful and provided multiple updates which allowed my partner and I to worry a lot less. Futhermore the way Black and White work as a team is very refreshing, the attention to detail in Chris\\' work meant that when we made visits to the branch when Chris was unavailable, David was able to pick up exactly where we were without delay.” Candice (May 2015)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\\"“Predominantly dealing with Chris Richards, we found his service and attentive nature to be excellent! We have now used B&W twice to find tenants and have been more than satisfied on both occasions. There was always a good level of communication and they were able to offer technical advise and reassurance when necessary. I will be using them again in the future.” Sian (June 2015)\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n“No doubt Black & White Estate Agents are the best in the area.
